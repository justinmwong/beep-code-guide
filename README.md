Beep code guide
This is a class project for my IT Pre-Apprenticeship. When I was studying for the A+ exams, I found beep codes challenging, so I thought I would create a guide. I got the information about the beep codes for several manufacturers from Computer Hope.

Potential Improvements
I would have liked to add styling to the welcome page, and would have liked it if the user could be able to listen to the beep code to make things easier. A dark mode/light mode toggle would have been nice. Some of the data from AirTable was retrieved in the wrong order. I would fix the data so that it is in alphabetical order. Finally, it would have been nice if everything was on one JavaScript file instead of multiple.
